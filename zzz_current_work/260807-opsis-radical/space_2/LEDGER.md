# space_2 — a port, not a redesign

space_1's whole server, with the leaf reduced to two halves it cannot have an
opinion about: a canvas that paints marks, and real text planes the browser
draws. Every visual decision below comes from a space_1 file, named.

## Where each thing came from

| here | ported from |
|---|---|
| `opsis/frame/tones.py` | `leaf/leaf.css` `:root` — the eleven variables, the faces, the line height |
| lane tones (closed · active · pending) | `leaf/chart.js` — fill to the CURSOR, not across the span; ahead-spans carry no fill |
| `eidolon/camera.py` | `leaf/graph.js` — layout-centred orbit, focal `max(900, reach·9)`, the fit as a BOUND so the picture cannot pump as it turns |
| facet titles, tab words | `praxis/reading.py` + `eidolon/topology.py` `graph_facet` — unchanged |
| the head (`h2`), the tab strip, the selects | `leaf.css` `.facet h2` / `.tabbar` / `#gview` |
| masthead, status, the hint sentence | `leaf/index.html` |
| the arrangement tree | `opsis/space.py` + `scene.staged` — the same tree, walked here instead of in the leaf |
| editing | `praxis/history.py` `retype` — an edit is a re-reading; the frontier is the kernel's own cursor, never scraped from prose |

## What changed, and only this

`scene.py` grew `staged()`: the decisions `scene()` was already making, in a
record, so the drawn frame reads the same ones instead of making its own.
`scene()` still spells exactly what it spelled.

## Deviations still to redo

- The parity verdict clips at the right edge — the mono advance in `ADVANCE`
  is a measurement, and it is wrong.
- THE SPINE overruns its region; it needs the region's own bound.
- Ctrl+wheel zoom (`doc.zoom`, `chart.zoom`, `spine.zoom`) is not wired.
- The graph's own controls — `◉ focus`, `⧉ window`, the tune dials — are not
  drawn; only the view selector is.

· strata · places · verdict badges · the routes strip · Earley's column and
CAN COME NEXT in the spine · the gate.
